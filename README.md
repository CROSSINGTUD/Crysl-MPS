# CrySL MPS

This repository contains a MPS implementation of the [CrySL](https://www.eclipse.org/cognicrypt/documentation/crysl/) language used in [CogniCrypt](https://www.eclipse.org/cognicrypt/). This implementation follows the language specified in [Kr√ºger et al. (2018)](https://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2018/9215/pdf/LIPIcs-ECOOP-2018-10.pdf).

## Dependencies

To build the language dependencies to [mbeddr-platform](https://build.mbeddr.com/viewType.html?buildTypeId=Mbeddr2_Mbeddr_Gradle_platform) as well as [iets3.opensource](https://github.com/IETS3/iets3.opensource) need to be accessible by MPS.

## MPS Version

Currently the project still runs on the old 2020.3 version of MPS due to the iets3.opensource dependency not supporting any newer version so far.
